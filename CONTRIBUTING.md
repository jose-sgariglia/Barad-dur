## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Start by forking the repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the project under your account.

2. **Create a New Branch**  
    **Do not work directly on the `main` branch!**  
    Create a new branch from the `develop` branch for your work. For example:
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    
3. **Make Your Changes**
    Implement your improvements, bug fixes, or new features. Please ensure your code follows the existing style and conventions of the project.
    
4. **Commit Your Changes**
    Write clear, descriptive commit messages. For example:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add feature X to improve Y"
    ```
    
5. **Push and Create a Pull Request**
    Push your branch to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    Then, open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `develop` branch of the main repository. Make sure to explain your changes in detail and reference any relevant issues.
    
6. **Review Process**
    Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may suggest improvements or request further changes before merging.


## Additional Guidelines
